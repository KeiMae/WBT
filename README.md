# WBT
2016 修士論文で使用したアルゴリズム

2016's My Graduate article's Algorithm
Bubble detecter using time-frequency approch

Most of all codes are written as function,
so you can use easliy.
Note that you need Matlab 2014a or later.
This is because I used dwt() added in this versions


My core algoritm is WBT based on GSADF, Generalized Supreme ADF
About deteil of GSADF, see Phillips, Peter CB, Shu-Ping Shi, and Jun Yu. "Testing for multiple bubbles." (2012).

I replace ADF test of GSADF to wavelet based unitroot test(Fan, Yanqin, and Ramazan Gençay. "Unit root tests with wavelets." Econometric Theory 26.05 (2010): 1305-1331.)

Unfortunately, my articles written only in Japanese and only abstract is public thanks to my bass.
However, if you want to see my algorithm and my research result, please contact.
